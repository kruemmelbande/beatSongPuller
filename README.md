# Beat Song Puller
This tool reads a beatsaber custom song folder and then pulls all the songs into a neat play

## How to use:

### Extracting from PC:
Go into the script and disable pullDataFromQuest.  
Put your beatmaps in a folder named QuestMaps (will be changed later) in the same path as this script, then execute it.  

### Extracting from Quest:
Make sure you have adb in your path, then execute this script.  
Optionally you can delete the QuestMaps folder afterwards.  

## Known issues:  
Sometimes it fails to copy files correctly and sometimes it copies them with weird filenames
